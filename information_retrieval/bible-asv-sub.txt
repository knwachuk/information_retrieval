In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.
</P>

<P ID=2>
And the earth was waste and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep: and the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters
</P>

<P ID=3>
And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.
</P>

<P ID=4>
And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.
</P>

<P ID=5>
And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called Night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day.
</P>

<P ID=6>
And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.
</P>

<P ID=7>
And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament: and it was so.
</P>

<P ID=8>
And God called the firmament Heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.
</P>

<P ID=9>
And God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so.
</P>

<P ID=10>
And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.
</P>

<P ID=11>
And God said, Let the earth put forth grass, herbs yielding seed, [and] fruit-trees bearing fruit after their kind, wherein is the seed thereof, upon the earth: and it was so.
</P>

<P ID=12>
And the earth brought forth grass, herbs yielding seed after their kind, and trees bearing fruit, wherein is the seed thereof, after their kind: and God saw that it was good.
</P>

<P ID=13>
And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.
</P>

<P ID=14>
And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days and years:
</P>

<P ID=15>
and let them be for lights in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth: and it was so.
</P>

<P ID=16>
And God made the two great lights; the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the night: [he made] the stars also.
</P>

<P ID=17>
And God set them in the firmament of heaven to give light upon the earth,
</P>

<P ID=18>
and to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.
</P>

<P ID=19>
And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.
</P>

<P ID=20>
And God said, Let the waters swarm with swarms of living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven.
